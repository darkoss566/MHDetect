Description: MHDetect is an algorithm for detecting and classifying indels 
    (deletions, insertions, and MNVs) as microhomology-mediated end joining 
    (MMEJ)-dependent. The algorithm processes VCF files to classify indels, 
    evaluates microhomology patterns, and simulates DNA repair mechanisms 
    for MNVs. It outputs comprehensive data for deletions, insertions, and 
    MNVs, including dependencies on the MMEJ repair process. Users can set 
    key parameters 'k' (length of sequences before and after indels), 'N' 
    (minimum nucleotides for microhomology), 'genome' (reference genome), 
    and 'Interval' (region for DNA repair simulation). The package is 
    designed for use with R version 4.3.3 and relevant genomic libraries.
